# Idea, make a bongo cat type thing

- Should use the web browser to render the thing so that it's easy to import with OBS
- Should take minmal setup
    - Idea for now is to use some exe and have it run at startup maybe - can't use just webassembly because it's sandboxed



# Build
cargo build release


# Run
run pogo.exe
open index.html



# TODO;

- Make the event some standard json rather than a string (serde)
- Make the frontend actually do the thing
